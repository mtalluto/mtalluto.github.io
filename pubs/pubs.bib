abstract = {Abstract Aim More than ever, ecologists seek to understand how species are distributed and have assembled into communities using the “filtering framework”. This framework is based on the hypothesis that local assemblages result from a series of abiotic and biotic filters applied to regional species pools and that these filters leave predictable signals in observed diversity patterns. In theory, statistical comparisons of expected and observed patterns enable data-driven tests of assembly processes. However, so far this framework has fallen short in delivering generalizable conclusions, challenging whether (and how) diversity patterns can be used to characterize and understand underlying assembly processes better. Methods By synthesizing the previously raised critiques and suggested solutions in a comprehensive way, we identify 10 pitfalls that can lead to flawed interpretations of α-diversity patterns, summarize solutions developed to circumvent these pitfalls and provide general guidelines. Results We find that most issues arise from an overly simplistic view of potential processes that influence diversity patterns, which is often motivated by practical constraints on study design, focal scale and methodology. We outline solutions for each pitfall, such as methods spanning over spatial, environmental or phylogenetic scales, and suggest guidelines for best scientific practices in community ecology. Among key future challenges are the integration of mechanistic modelling and multi-trophic interactions. Main conclusions Our conclusion is that the filtering framework still holds promise, but only if researchers successfully navigate major pitfalls, foster the integration of mechanistic modelling and multi-trophic interactions and directly account for uncertainty in their conclusions.},

abstract = {Abstract Dispersal is a key life-history trait for most species and is essential to ensure connectivity and gene flow between populations and facilitate population viability in variable environments. Despite the increasing importance of range shifts due to global change, dispersal has proved difficult to quantify, limiting empirical understanding of this phenotypic trait and wider synthesis. Here, we introduce a statistical framework to estimate standardised dispersal kernels from biased data. Based on this, we compare empirical dispersal kernels for European breeding birds considering age (average dispersal; natal, before first breeding; and breeding dispersal, between subsequent breeding attempts) and sex (females and males) and test whether different dispersal properties are phylogenetically conserved. We standardised and analysed data from an extensive volunteer-based bird ring-recoveries database in Europe (EURING) by accounting for biases related to different censoring thresholds in reporting between countries and to migratory movements. Then, we fitted four widely used probability density functions in a Bayesian framework to compare and provide the best statistical descriptions of the different age and sex-specific dispersal kernels for each bird species. The dispersal movements of the 234 European bird species analysed were statistically best explained by heavy-tailed kernels, meaning that while most individuals disperse over short distances, long-distance dispersal is a prevalent phenomenon in almost all bird species. The phylogenetic signal in both median and long dispersal distances estimated from the best-fitted kernel was low (Pagel's λ < 0.25), while it reached high values (Pagel's λ >0.7) when comparing dispersal distance estimates for fat-tailed dispersal kernels. As expected in birds, natal dispersal was on average 5 km greater than breeding dispersal, but sex-biased dispersal was not detected. Our robust analytical framework allows sound use of widely available mark-recapture data in standardised dispersal estimates. We found strong evidence that long-distance dispersal is common among European breeding bird species and across life stages. The dispersal estimates offer a first guide to selecting appropriate dispersal kernels in range expansion studies and provide new avenues to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and rules underlying dispersal events.}

abstract = {Abstract The mayfly Prosopistoma pennigerum (Müller, 1785) (Insecta: Ephemeroptera) once occurred in many European river networks. However, observations decreased in the last decades and the species can be considered largely extinct throughout Europe due to river alterations. Only three extant populations are known from Cabriel (southern Spain), Volga (Russia) and Vjosa (Albania) rivers. We recorded the species along a 150 km stretch in the Vjosa River in three sampling seasons (spring 2018, fall 2018 and fall 2019), counting up to 302 P. pennigerum per m2, the highest recorded abundance for the species to date. Moreover, we detected traces of environmental DNA in a newly designed targeted eDNA assay. In our modelling approach we define the species' niche in a theoretically available niche space given by the Vjosa River network and predict a high probability of presence (θ\$\$ \theta \$\$) in downstream located sections of this river. Expected abundances (λ) could be related to a set of environmental variables, importantly to higher discharge and increased sediment dynamics. Simultaneous occurrence of larvae of different sizes at individual sites suggests an asynchronous life cycle, which may be advantageous to cope with the highly dynamic river hydrology. The P. pennigerum population in the Vjosa is of key importance for the species' global survival.}
